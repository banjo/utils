# @banjoanton/utils

A collection of some of my most used JavaScript / TypeScript utility functions.

-   :palm_tree: - Three shakable ESM modules.
-   :speech_balloon: - Fully typed TSDocs with examples
-   :star: - No dependencies
-   :file_folder: - Small size
-   :bookmark: - Own well-tested utilities or imported from large open source projects.

The package is designed to be used as `devDependencies` and bundled into your dist.

# @banjoanton/utils

A collection of some of my most used JavaScript / TypeScript utility functions.

-   :palm_tree: - Three-shakable ESM modules.
-   :speech_balloon: - Fully typed TSDocs with examples
-   :file_folder: - Small size
-   :bookmark: - Own well-tested utilities or imported from large open source projects.

There are two packages:

-   `@banjoanton/utils` - JS / TS utilities. 
-   `@banjoanton/node-utils` - Node.js specific utilities.

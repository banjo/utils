# @banjoanton/utils

A collection of some of my most used JavaScript / TypeScript utility functions.

-   :palm_tree: - Three-shakable ESM modules.
-   :speech_balloon: - Fully typed TSDocs with examples
-   :file_folder: - Small size
-   :bookmark: - Own well-tested utilities or imported from large open source projects.

There are two packages (click for docs):

-   [`@banjoanton/utils`](https://github.com/banjo/utils/tree/main/packages/utils) - JS / TS utilities. 
-   [`@banjoanton/node-utils`](https://github.com/banjo/utils/tree/main/packages/node) - Node.js specific utilities.
